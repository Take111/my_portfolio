## About me

I am Takenouchi and I have been involved in iOS/Flutter app development. 

I have experience in both new development and maintenance of apps, having worked on an app for over 5 years that has been in operation since the 0 phase of the iOS native project.

 Recently, I have also been developing apps using Flutter. 
 
 Currently, I am a freelancer. 
 
 At the company I used to work for, I was not only evaluated for my technical skills but also for my communication skills. 
 
 This allows me to progress with development while actively communicating within the team.
